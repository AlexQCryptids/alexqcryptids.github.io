      <p> Currently I'm working on two games: Botting Alive and another game about science & scientists. <br>
          <br>
          Although I cannot say too much about the science game, Botting Alive could be a rather interesting topic. Basically it's a game created by VGDev@Georgia Tech, and I happened to be the team leader <br>
          TLDR; What if you are buried alive and all you have is a broken Apple Watch?  You can play it on itch.io (https://malcolmq.itch.io/bottingalivevgdev)<br>
          You might think this game is crappy. Well, so do I, and that's the reason I'm rebuilding it featuring a more realistic story and denser gameplay. The working title is B.A.
