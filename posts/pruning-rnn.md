# Pruning RNNs with Biological Constraints

In this post, I reflect on how incorporating biological realism — like Dale's law or structured sparsity — can improve both interpretability and robustness of recurrent neural networks.

## Key Ideas

- Connections are pruned based on covariance
- Remaining weights may be strengthened to preserve dynamics
- Biological constraints can help generate low-rank solutions naturally
