*Me? I've always loved porters. Through freezing rain and biting wind, across rivers, mountains, and endless deserts. They come to deliver something priceless. A glimpse of a life I've never known. They're my window - my sole connection to the outside world. And I know they'll be back again today.  --Death Stranding 2*

The time has finally come, I'm taking a year off to pursue something I've wanted to do for a long time: creating video games.

No it doesn't mean I've wasted all the past years drowning in the spiking ocean spun by countless entangled and twisted neurons, nor I've suddenly become some mad guy living in a basement staring at screen until stars faded into the dawn light. But I've been chatting with ghosts who died years ago yet still wondering in the cord of karma conciouslessly. And they told me, 'just do it.'

The ghosts are me, the past me. They were gripping a cracked plastic pen, weaving the twisted yet childish fates of hand-drawn characters, hoping to get published in a sketchy comic journal. They were holding a dusty camera, cloaked in scratches, filming kids clumsily acting out scripted scenes. They were dragging a stubborn mouse, editing amateur-shot scenes into a short film, only to let the fiction in the heads delude themselves. They were watering newly grown, tissue-cultivated plants, staring out the window at a construction site, waiting for the storm to come.

They were lost in the spiral of inevitable fate, cut off from connection, thought to be gone forever. Yet I found them. Surely, it took me years, but eventually I found them. Or maybe they found me. And that was the moment I finally woke up from the long dream, as if mountains finally answer your call by echoing your own name. 

In the deep bottom of my heart, I simply want to be a creator. And video games (or interactive art if you prefer) is the best media fit with me. I want to tell stories, share ideas, or just create something trapped in my mind for years. To me, game creators are porters, delivering something priceless, and building up connections across shapeless walls. They do matter.

I don't really regret all those nerdy years digging into the science rabbit hole. They gifted me with a different kind of beauty, a beauty shaped by rigor and elegance, carved into my bones and etched into the fabrics of my thoughts. But now it's finally a good time for begin a new journey. As they said, 'if there is something you truly want to do, don't hesitate, just do it now.' And I said, 'take the risk, do the gamble, and hope for good luck.'

So byebye my neuroscientist career, for now or maybe forever. I'm going to create my own games. Just wish me good luck.
