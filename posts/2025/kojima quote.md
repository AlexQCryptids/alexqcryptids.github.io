*So if there are 10 players playing it, and nine people are happy with it, it will be just like a 'blockbuster entertainment'. Because everyone will forget it. But what I want to do is, if there are 10 people, four people will say, 'I love it. I will never forget this for the rest of my life.' But the six will go, 'I don't know yet.' but they will try it. And then those four will become followers, like creators in the future. That's my ultimate dream.*
