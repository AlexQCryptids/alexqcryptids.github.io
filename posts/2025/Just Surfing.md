I never thought surfing would be my thing, but after trying it for the first time in Hawaii, I fell in love straight away. As I'm flying back to China to concentrate on my game dev, I took a detour to Da Nang, Viet Nam to train whenver I can.

Saying it not being painful as a beginner would be either be a lie or simply sugercoating. And things only get worse in Da Nang, as you normally don't get consistant waves as in Waikiki. It's chaotic, mooddy, and irritable. Hard to read, tricky to mess up, and impatient to carry you even for a short while. I thought I know how to at least catch a good wave in Waikiki, but Da Nang just yelled at me with a huge 'No!'

Perhaps I overblamed this town, as I probably forgot some basics moves, and jumped into the water with a starving stomach, and it's my first day in Da Nang. But it was still brutal. Wave broke and bubbles crackled, just another round of failed takeoff. 

I stood up in the sizzling water, grabbed to leash to pull the board back, and paddled in, with endless waves collapsing in front of me. When the surface finally calms down, I sat down on the board, excausted from the tense paddling. 

Dusk was falling, but the twilight was faint. The wind carried distant waves gently to the shore and swept across my body, warm and tender, and surprisingly, not fishy. To my left stood the mountain draped in vibrant green as you could almost hear the cried and echoes of the wilds. Dim white clouds crowned its ridges, drifting so freely that they seemed ready to burst anytime, yet they lingered, calm and empty.

It was that moment that I thought, 'Even if I can't catch any wave, just sitting here chilling would be great.' This isn’t the first time I’ve had this thought, but it’s the first time it became so clear that I found myself regretting not having realized it sooner. 

But I didn't rest too long. Soon another wave was coming. I turned around, ready to paddle for another takeoff.
